      <description>Heron processing topologies can be written using an API called the Heron ECO API. The ECO API is currently available to work with spouts and bolts from the following packages:
 org.apache.storm  We will expand compatibility based on feedback we get from the community.
 Although this document focuses on the ECO API, both the Streamlet API and Topology API topologies you have built can still be used with Heron</description>

      <description>Heron on Kubernetes configuration Current Limitations Only the submit and kill commands are currently supported. Other CLI commands (activate, deactivate, restart, update) are currently in development and will be released soon.
Zookeeper To run Heron on k8s, you will need a Zookeeper cluster. You can choose to use a zookeeper cluster outside of k8s if you&amp;rsquo;d like (only if it&amp;rsquo;s accessible from the k8s cluster nodes), but most often you will probably want to deploy your own Zookeeper cluster inside of k8s.</description>

      <description>Heron processing topologies can be written using an API called the Heron Streamlet API. The Heron Streamlet API is currently available for the following languages:
 Java    Although this document covers the new Heron Streamlet API, topologies created using the original topology API can still be used with Heron (which means that all of your older topologies will still run).
 For a more in-depth conceptual guide to the new API, see The Heron Streamlet API.</description>
